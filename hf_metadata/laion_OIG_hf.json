Some datasets may also include a 'metadata' field. The 'text' field contains a string of the form of one or more of:\n\n<human>: instruction\\n<bot>: response\n<human>: instruction\\n<bot>: response .. <human>:\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/OIG.",
