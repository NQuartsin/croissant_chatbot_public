  "description": "NaturalReasoning is a large-scale dataset for general reasoning tasks. It consists of high-quality challenging reasoning questions backtranslated from pretraining corpora DCLM and FineMath. The questions have been deduplicated and decontaminated from popular reasoning benchmarks including MATH, GPQA, MMLU-Pro, MMLU-STEM. For each question, we extract the reference final answer from the original document from the pretraining corpora if possible. We also provide a model-generated response from\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/natural_reasoning.",
