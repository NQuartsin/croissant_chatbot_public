It was a step in the right direction, but still relatively small with 800K objects.\nObjaverse-XL is over an order of magnitude larger and much more diverse!\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUnlocking Generalization\n\t\n\nCompared\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/objaverse-xl.",
