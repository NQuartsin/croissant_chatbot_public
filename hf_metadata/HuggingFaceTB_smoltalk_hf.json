More details in our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02737\nDuring the development of SmolLM2, we observed that models finetuned on public SFT datasets underperformed compared to other models with proprietary instruction datasets. To address this gap, we created new synthetic datasets\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smoltalk.",
