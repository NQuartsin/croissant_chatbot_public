This dataset was built with text-to-sql LLMs in mind, intending to prevent hallucination of column and table names often seen when trained on text-to-sql datasets. The CREATE TABLE statement can often be copy and pasted from different DBMS and provides table names\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/b-mc2/sql-create-context.",
