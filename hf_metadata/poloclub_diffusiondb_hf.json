  "description": "DiffusionDB is the first large-scale text-to-image prompt dataset. It contains 2\nmillion images generated by Stable Diffusion using prompts and hyperparameters\nspecified by real users. The unprecedented scale and diversity of this\nhuman-actuated dataset provide exciting research opportunities in understanding\nthe interplay between prompts and generative models, detecting deepfakes, and\ndesigning human-AI interaction tools to help users more easily use these models.",
