You can use it to initialize your models with the reasoning chain from Deepseek-R1.\n[2024/12/25] We open-sourced the medical reasoning dataset for SFT, built on medical verifiable problems and an LLM verifier.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIntroduction\n\t\n\nThis dataset is used to fine-tune HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM designed for advanced medical reasoning. This dataset is constructed using GPT-4o\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT.",
