The dataset was created to support the task of question answering on basic mathematical problems that require multi-step reasoning.\n\nThese problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve.\nSolutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ \u2212 \u00d7\u00f7) to reach the\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k.",
