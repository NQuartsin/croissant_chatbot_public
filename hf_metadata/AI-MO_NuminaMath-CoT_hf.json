The sources of the dataset range from Chinese high school math exercises to US and international mathematics olympiad competition problems. The data were primarily collected from online exam paper PDFs and mathematics discussion forums. The processing steps include (a) OCR from the original PDFs, (b) segmentation\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-MO/NuminaMath-CoT.",
