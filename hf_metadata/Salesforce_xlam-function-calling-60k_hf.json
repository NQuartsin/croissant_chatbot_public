Each data in our dataset is verified through three hierarchical stages: format checking, actual function executions, and semantic verification, ensuring its reliability and correctness. \nWe conducted human evaluation over 600 sampled data points, and\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k.",
