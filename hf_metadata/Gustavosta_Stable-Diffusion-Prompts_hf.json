It was a little difficult to extract the data, since the search engine still doesn't have a public API without being protected by cloudflare.\nIf you want to test the model with a demo, you can go to: \"spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion\".\nIf you want to see the model, go to: \"Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion\".\n",
