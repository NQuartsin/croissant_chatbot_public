It consists of 220k math problems with two to four reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek R1 for problems from NuminaMath 1.5. \nThe traces were verified using Math Verify for most samples and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as a judge for 12% of the samples, and each problem contains at least one reasoning trace with a correct answer.\nThe dataset consists of two splits:\u2026 See the full description on the dataset page: https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k.",
