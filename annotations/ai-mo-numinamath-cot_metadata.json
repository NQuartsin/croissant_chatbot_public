  "description": "The NuminaMath-CoT dataset is a significant contribution to the field of AI and mathematics education. With over 860k math problems sourced from various origins, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to study and develop AI models that can solve math problems using a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach. The problems range from high school exercises to those from international mathematics olympiads, making it a valuable resource for researchers and educators alike. The dataset was primarily collected from online exam paper PDFs and mathematics discussion forums, and its processing steps include OCR and segmentation.",
