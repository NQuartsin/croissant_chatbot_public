  "description": "The FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT dataset is a groundbreaking resource for the AI community, particularly for those interested in medical reasoning. It was created by FreedomIntelligence and is based on medical verifiable problems. This dataset, which was open-sourced in 2024, is designed to fine-tune HuatuoGPT-o1, a cutting-edge medical Language Learning Model (LLM). The dataset, built using GPT-4o, is unique in its ability to search for solutions to complex medical problems and validate them through a medical verifier, making it an invaluable tool for advanced medical reasoning tasks.",
