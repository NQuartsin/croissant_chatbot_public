  "description": "OpenR1-Math-220k is a large-scale dataset of 220k math problems, each accompanied by multiple reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek R1. This dataset, sourced from NuminaMath 1.5, is a valuable resource for researchers interested in mathematical reasoning and deep learning. The traces have been verified using Math Verify for most samples and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as a judge for 12% of the samples, ensuring a high level of accuracy. Each problem in the dataset contains at least one reasoning trace with a correct answer, making it an ideal dataset for training and testing mathematical reasoning models.",
